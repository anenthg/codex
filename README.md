Code for some of my apps

Playstore Apps :

8 Puzzle - Got 9000+ Downloads for this app. This is a tile based game. Where you have to move the tiles horizontaly or vertically to get a certain patterm The app gives the fastest solution possible through "Boost" and "Solution" functionality. Used A* algorithm.

Stock Alert NSE - My most recent playstore app. The app lets you configure your favorite stocks to recieve notifications You can also "Pin" your stocks to the notification bar and control the refresh from there. I have tried to use more android components in this app especially used listview indepth with animations

RSS Reader - App to read news feed.

The other two apps Easy Metro and Dot 2 Dot, I did them as a challenge in programming contests. Those apps were in done in 2-3 days
